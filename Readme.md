# Restricted Boltzmann Machines

The code in this repository aims to implement the learning and inference procedures for a Restricted Boltzmann Machine as described in [1]

## TODO:
1. Implement a simple Restricted Boltzmann Machine class
- What does this class require? 
	- Ways to store binary vectors for both hidden and visible vectors
	- Store weight matrix
	- Update the weights based on stochastic gradient descent
	- Inference on some dataset (Netflix - filtered down to 2? )
